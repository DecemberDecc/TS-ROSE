This repository contains the official implementation of our paper: "Detection-driven Two-Stage Framework for Intraoperative ROSE WSI Classification".


We propose a clinically-inspired two-stage framework combining a detection transformer (RoF-DETR) and a prototype-guided MIL (PGMIL) model to enable accurate and efficient classification of smear cytology whole-slide images (WSIs) in rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) settings.
The method is designed to assist intraoperative diagnosis during EUS-FNA/B procedures for solid pancreatic lesions.


The source code and pretrained model weights for both the RoF-DETR detector and the PGMIL classifier will be made publicly available upon publication of this work.
